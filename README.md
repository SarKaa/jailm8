# Jailm8

Formerly Bootm8

An even better iso that lets users jb with checkra1n

This project started off when I decided to make my own version of checkn1x, which also supported project sandcastle

So that got me thinking, I could do this myself, I dont need someone else doing the hard work

Plus quarantine got me bored

Instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/SarKaa/jailm8/wiki/Jailm8-wiki)


I am open to any additions, as this is no longer just a checkra1n bootable iso, it is now a tool for more, and I want to add even more functionality to it, so if you have any ideas or suggestions just add an issue, I really want to make a muilti-purpose tool for both amateurs and developers (I don't see why but ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ )


List of extras:

Project sandcastle Android

Project sandcastle linux

Irecovery


Sorry for the bad formatting, I am not used to using GitHub like this, but hopefully it is easy to understand

This repo does not host any source code, it is just hosting useful files for the project, hence just to avoid confusion, THIS IS NOT OPEN SOURCE

NOTE: etcher will not work when writing the iso

Thanks to the checkra1n team for checkra1n

Thanks to asineth0 for inspiration and teaching me(without knowing) about squashfs and linux terminal commands
